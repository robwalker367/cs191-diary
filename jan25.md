Joseph Weizenbaum's *ELIZA - A Computer Program for the Study of Natural Language Communication between Man and Machine* (1966)

### Context
![Joseph Weizenbaum](/assets/weizenbaum.jpg)
- Joseph Weizenbaum (1923 - 2008)
  - German Jewish refugee
  - Math / computing @ Wayne State University
  - MIT CS Professor
- ELIZA was a chatbot that mimicked human speech
- Time-sharing made this an example of the first fun (and not just practical) program
- Named after Eliza Doolittle from George Bernard Shaw's *Pygmalion* (inspired film *My Fair Lady*)
- Animation of the inanimate
- Skeptical of humanizing machines and AI (argument in *Computer Power and Human Reason*)

### Paper

**Learnings**
- Weizenbaum seems to argue against ELIZA as being magic / AI, breaking down its components to show that it is not truly magic / AI and can be understood by a human
  - "ELIZA is a program which makes natural language conversation with a computer possible."
- Eliza works (basically) by:
  - Linear searching for a keyword in the text with highest priority, choosing from predefined list of keywords; if no keyword found respond with a predefined phrase or connect to a previous comment (stored in memory)
  - Identify some context
  - Apply a transformation rule
- Weizenbaum seems to argue that the "specialness" of ELIZA is projected upon it by the human interacting with the machine (similar to Life of Pi and the tiger)
- People develop their own models of the machine, alternating between *credibility* and *plausibility*; the most convincing model is the "therapist model" which makes it seem like the machine knows things; Weizenbaum argues that the "therapist model" is the only "serious" model
- ELIZA connects with Turing's *Computing Machinery and Intelligence* (1951)
- Weizenbaum argues that ELIZA is a "translating processor" (similar to the Chinese Room argument - it does not actually understand)

**Questions**
- What does it say about our conception of computers that question marks can't be used with ELIZA because question marks were reserved as a delete character on the MAC time sharing system?
- What does it mean to understand? How does ELIZA make us reconsider what it means to interact / converse? What can a machine "know" and "understand"?
- What are the characteristics of the translating processor?
- Is ELIZA special?

**Takeaways**
- Weizenbaum argues that ELIZA is not special but is simply a program that humans project their own beliefs upon.
