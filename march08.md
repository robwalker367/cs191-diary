## Norbert Wiener's *Some Moral and Technical Consequences of Automation* (1960)

### Context
- Nobert Wiener
  - 19/20th C. mathematician
  - Child prodigy (Tufts @ 11yrs old, Harvard PhD @ 18)
  - Spent career at MIT, dedicated to cybernetics
- Cybernetics -- originated from Greek to steer a boat / tiller; feedback and control systems
- "To provide scientific information is not a necessarily innocent act..." (1946 open letter to a military contractor who asked for one of his papers); in the wake of Hiroshima / Nagasaki
- Withdrew from any gov't funding (patronage), causing scientific influence to wane

### Paper
- Wiener argues against the common conception that machines can only output what is input into them, and cannot possess originality, and then argues for the dangers of automation on humans
- Games
  - Computers can now beat humans at certain games, highlighting their potential to expand the limits of intelligence
  - Games as toy examples
  - Machines transcending humans
- Learning machines may exist, which may be used in a "push-botton war"
- Wiener's "Man and Slave" section is problematic
- Mentions genie / monkey's paw / Fantasia's Sorcerer's Apprentice as examples of automation gone wrong
  - I wonder if Sorcerer's Apprentice did reflect anxieties over automation at the time?
- Scientists must work in their own time scales
- Publishes "A Scientist Rebels", becoming a "dark hero" in the process

## McCarthy, Minsky, Rochester, Shannon's *A Proposal for the Dartmouth Summer Research Project on Artificial Intelligence* (1955)
- This proposal outlines a proposal for 10 computer scientists to work for 2 months on aspects of computer intelligence
- The question: can intelligence be defined so that a machine can simulate it?
  - Automatic computers
  - Computers using language
  - Neuron nets
  - Theory of size of calculation
  - Self-improvement
  - Abstractions
  - Randomness and Creativity
