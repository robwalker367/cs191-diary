## Aristotle, *Prior Analytics* (~300BC)

### Context

- Aristotle
  - 4th C. BC Greek philosopher / lecturer
  - Known as the "great systematizer"
- *Prior Analytics* (~350BC)
  - Foundation of all modern logic
  - Lewis argues that Aristotle was the first to abstract logic from the content of what is said
  - Aristotle's "deductions" are a form computation

### Paper

**Learnings**
- Aristotle makes a highly structured argument by defining key terms and then formalizing relationships between those terms.
  - Discusses modern-day equivalent of set relationships and logic
- Does not have mathematical notation and so it feels very much like a philosophy paper; furthermore, Aristotle bases his logic in language not in numbers
- Some key terms:
  - Premise: demonstrative, dialectical, deductive
  - Term
  - Deduction: complete, incomplete
  - "Predicated of every" vs "predicated of none"
  - Demonstrations: demonstrations are subsets of deductions
- Argues transitivity

**Questions**
- What other works on computation exist before Aristotle? What is Aristotle building on? Having Aristotle as the first paper in chronological order is a highly eurocentric argument and I'm curious to know what other work on computation was done up to that (Lewis also jumps directly to the Rennaisance, ignoring the medieval period completely)
- What happened between Aristotle and Boole in the field of Logic?
- Is applying "Logic" to what Aristotle is doing anachronistic? What names did they have for the field in Greek?

**Takeaways**
- Reading *Prior Analytics* feelings like reading a very immature idea in a very different form.


## George Boole, *An Investigation on the Laws of thought* (1853)

### Context
- George Boole (19th C)
  - English mathematician and founder of algebraic tradiction in logic
  - Professor @ Queen's University (Ireland)
  - Self-taught mathematician, son of a shoemaker

### Paper

**Learnings**
- Boole's arguments are based almost entirely in language until he shows that language can be expressed in numbers 0 and 1
- Develops ideas from basic first principles showing how logic can be expressed mathematically
  - $x^2 = x$
- Tons to dive into here. Some key points:
  - Classes are sets
  - 0 is nothing, 1 is the universe
  - Commutativity
  - Distributivity
  - There are differences with algebra (cannot divide expression $z$ from $zx = zy$ to have $x = y$)
  - Law of duality $x(1 - x) = 0$
  - Primary (things), Secondary (propositions)
  - Formalizations can address more things than language can without ambiguity
- Notation and abstraction

**Questions**
- Is repetition meaningless in language?
- Does quantum break the law of duality?
- Did Boole discover or invent logic?

**Takeaways**
- Fascinating algebra of logic that is honestly pretty beautiful.


# Claude Shannon, *A Symbolic Analysis of Relays and Switching Circuits* (1938)

### Context
- Claude Shannon
  - 20th C philosopher
  - EE @ UMich, PhD @ MIT
  - Known as the founder of information theory
  - Founded digital circuit theory

### Paper

**Learnings**
- Honestly a lot of the circuitry stuff went over my head (I'm not familiar with this), but Shannon shows how we can take Boole's work on logic and apply it to electronics to solve industrial problems

**Questions**
- Who else was working on these problems? Was Boole "rediscovered" or "discovered" by Shannon?

**Takeaways**
- Shannon's work is an example of taking work in one field and applying it to another in a powerful way.
