### Questions for every paper

- Who is the author?
- What is the big idea of this paper? (Keep this simple)
- What are the arguments that the author is making in the paper?
- Why is the author making these arguments?
- How is the author making these arguments?
- How does the paper connect to other papers and ideas?

### Diary

- Mention one key concept for discussion

### Video Project

- Classic paper - noteworthy for vision or impact (may even be wrong!)
- 5-minutes exactly
- Pitch your idea (not necessarily high production value, but should be decent)
