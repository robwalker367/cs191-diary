## Questions to consider:
- Is the brain a computer?
- Can the brain be described as a logical automaton?
- Can computers be programmed to do brainlike things?
  - McCulloch & Pitts, Rosenblatt was really first ML paper

## Warren Mcculloch and Walter Pitts, *A Logical Calculus of the Ideas Immanent in Nervous Activity* (1943)

### Notes
- Paper tries to model the brain as a digital computer (modern day threshold logic); fails do to so accurately
- Key terms:
  - Peripheral afferents
  - Efferents
  - Threshold $\theta_i$ (neuron $i$ fires of more than $\theta_i$ inputs fire)
  - Memory are cycles of activity 
- Paper is confusing and poorly written
- Walter Pitts (20th C.)
  - American logician / mathematician, son of working-class family
  - Self-taught, ran away at 15
  - Hung around University of Chicago, met McCulloch who took him in
  - Ended up at MIT

## Frank Rosenblatt *The Perceptron: A Probabilistic Model for Information Storage and Organization* (1958)

### Notes
- Frank Rosenblatt
  - 20th C. American psychologist
  - AB and PhD @ Cornell
  - Spent rest of life in research
- Perceptron - experiment in artificial learning that was the first instance of AI / ML neural nets; technology limited development at the time
- Symbolic vs. neural AI
  - Minksy (symbolic) saw neural AI (Rosenblatt) as a threat to research
  - Minksy published a paper to prove that neural AI was limited
  - Rosenblatt, as a result, could not get funding
