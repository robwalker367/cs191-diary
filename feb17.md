## Pre-class discussion
- What accounts for the influence of a vision piece?
- Two good scientists who were not great scientists

## Vannevar Bush *As We May Think* (1945)

### Context
- Vannevar Bush
  - 20th C. American engineer, academic, and policy-maker
  - Director of OSRD during WW2 and involved in administration of Manhattan Project
  - Founder of the NSF (National Science Foundation) and strong advocate for the involvement of government in funding basic research
- Memex
  - Device by which we record all of human knowledge that humans can then access
  - This paper was published first in the Atlantic, then a subsequent more digestable version was published in Life

### Paper
- Bush outlines his vision for the future and the many possibilities, barriers, and next steps needed to advance science specifically around the transmission, storage, and retrieval of knowledge; Bush essentially predicts a digital future
  - Increased recording capabilities (e.g., Walnut-sized camera)
  - Storing the *Encyclopedia Britannica* in a matchbox
  - Speech to text and text to speech
- Arguments:
  - Large scientific force mobilized for the war and now need direction
  - Science has a positive impact on national interests
  - There is a new opportunity for machines to aid humans, especially in repetitive tasks
  - Humans think by association, and so machines should be designed to operate by association
- "The world has arrived at an age of cheap complex devices of great reliability; and something is bound to come of it."
- Memex (a portmanteau of "memory" and "index"?)
- Analogy of laying a thread through the labyrinth of human information / knowledge
- What makes human thought different from a machine?

## J.C.R. Licklider

### Context
- J.C.R. Licklider
  - 20th C. American psychologist, nicknamed "Lick"
  - Alternated career in academia, industry, and military
  - Knew Bush from MIT
  - Worked on ARPANET

### Paper
- Licklider argues that humans and computers can act symbiotically, amplifying each others strengths while covereing each others weaknesses, and should be coupled to advance humankind
- Arguments:
  - There is a difference between "mechanically extended man" and man-computer symbiosis
  - Humans think creatively, whereas machines think mechanistically
- Requirements of symbiosis:
  - Time-sharing
  - Memory hardware components
  - Memory organization
  - Programming languages
  - I/O equipment
    - Desk-surface display / control
    - Computer-posted wall display
    - Automatic speech production and recognition

**Questions**
- What are the criterion for a "symbiotic" relationship between human and machine?
- What should computers do? What should humans do?
