## L.F. Manabrea, with Notes by the Translator, Ada Augusta, Countess of Lovelace, *Sketch of the Analytical Engine* (1843)

### Context

- Charles Babbage
  - 18-19th C. British mathematician, professor @ Cambridge
  - "Difference Engine" system of gears / wheels calculating polynomials
  - Conceived of "Analytical Engine" in mid-1830s
- Ada Augusta
  - 19th C. English mathematician, daughter of Lord Byron
  - Recognized greater possibilities of Babbage's Analytical Engine, created the first algorithm for the machine
- Analytical Engine was not able to be built due to limits of technology at the time
- Luigi Federico Manbrea
  - 19th C. Italian engineer
- Manbrea wrote up Babbage's lectures, then Lovelace translated them
- Lectures mention:
  - Compilation
  - Step counting
  - Loops
  - Exception handling
  - Solving linear systems of equations
  - Code vs data
  - Nonnumeric computing
  - Understimation of difficulties of computing

### Paper

**Learnings**
- Babbage argues for the usefulness and possibilities that an Analytical Engine can perform
- Key characteristics that they are concerned about:
  - Correctness
  - Economy of time
  - Economy of intelligence
- View humans as sources of error (superiority of machine over the human brain); machines will let us focus on loftier efforts (heirarchy of thinking)
  - "Human weakness"
  - "Its province is to assist us in making available what we are already acquainted with"
- Thinking being vs. an automaton of different states that acts in accordance to laws imposed upon it
- Key objects:
  - Operations
  - Variables
  - Mil
- Variables stored on rotating discs, loaded into a mill (almost like an ALU), operation operates, then result is loaded back
- Punch-card mechanism based on Jacquard's weaving punch-card mechanism
- Lovelace then expands upon what Babbage imagines, arguing that the Analytical Engine can be used more abstractly and do more than expected

**Questions**
- Who is the audience here? Why is Babbage making these arguments? Who is the patron?

## Howard Hathaway Aiken *A Proposed Automatic Calculating Machine* (1937)

### Context
- Howard Aiken
  - 20th C. physics professor @ Harvard
  - Academic, military, and industrial background
  - Proposed industrial support for Mark I development

### Paper

**Learnings**
- Aiken argues for the usefulness of a calculating machine that could propel the development of sciences in order to get funding for the development of such a machine
  - Currently we have "insufficient means of mechanical computation"
- Begins by tracing historical roots: abacus, Napier's Bones, the slide rule
- Babbage got funding from the British Government to build the analytical machine (implication that Aiken should get funding too)
- Outlines the difference between accounting machinery and calculating machinery
- Proposes mathematical operations, means of building those operations, current ways to create the machine, and speed suggestions

**Questions**
- Why are calculating machines built?
- Who is Aiken's audience? Why is he writing this proposal? What is the impact of patronage on this proposal?
